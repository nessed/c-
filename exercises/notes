first loop through whole array to find the smallest in the array
    then place that smallest into the first index
    find the index of the smallest 
    replace index err
    reassign arr[1] with n 
    reassign arr[2] with arr[1]
    reassign[3] with arr[2]
    reassign

    loop through find smallest 
    [1,2,3]
    [4,3,2]
    
    smallest is at 3 index
    replace index arr[1] with arr[3]
